# Tech Directory

This directory is designed to help speedrunners navigate and explore various techniques that can be utilized to optimize their gameplay and enhance their speedrunning experience.

In this directory, you will find a list of techniques categorized as "Glitched," "Intended," and "Mirabras Rabbithole." Each technique is thoroughly described with information relevant to speedrunners.

- **Glitched**: This category includes techniques that require obvious unintended behavior or break game rules and/or were fixed in later versions of the game.

- **Intended**: Techniques in this category weren't fixed in later versions or came as a default feature but aren't too obvious to be considered strictly "playing under the rules."

- **Mirabras Rabbithole**: This category refers to any technique derived from Prayer Cancelling Mirabras of the Return to the Port prayer. As a default, all techniques under this umbrella require at least Mirabras and 2 different weapons; however, they may have additional requirements.

Please note that within the "Mirabras Rabbithole" category, techniques may have additional requirements beyond the minimum mentioned.
