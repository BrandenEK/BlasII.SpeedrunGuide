## Introduction

"Blasphemous 2" is an exciting metroidvania game known for its challenging gameplay and intricate level design. Speedrunners aim to complete the game as quickly as possible by exploiting tricks, glitches, and employing advanced strategies.

This repository serves as a central hub for documenting these techniques and providing insights into how they can be used to optimize speedruns.

The goal is to promote in-depth game knowledge collaboratively discovered by the speedrunning community in the game. However, it's important to note that this guide is not intended to be an ultimate guide on which routes should be taken. Instead, it aims to share and document what is known and possible in the game at the time of its creation.

Additionally, please be aware that this guide is not definitive, and the knowledge about the game is expected to expand as new runs are completed and new strategies are discovered. It's a non-exhaustive resource, although striving to be as comprehensive as possible is the goal.

## Scene-by-Scene Documentation

In this wiki, we aim to document each scene of the game in detail, including the following information:

- Scene description
- Tricks, glitches, and strategies specific to that scene
- Videos, gifs, and images showcasing these techniques
- Links to related glitches, strats, and scene transitions

Please refer to the individual folders in this repository to access scene-specific documentation.

## Tech Directory

We maintain a directory of techniques, tricks, and glitches used in "Blasphemous 2." Each entry in the directory will include the following:

- Technique name
- Description of the technique
- Video demonstrations (if available)
- Related scenes and scenarios where the technique is applicable

Please check the "Tech" folder for detailed information on each technique.

## Versions

While the guide focuses on the Steam version of "Blasphemous 2," it is worth mentioning that the majority of the content and techniques apply equally to the GOG version of the game. Players on both platforms can benefit from the strategies and information provided here.

Please note that while many techniques may also work on console versions, the primary focus of this project is on the PC versions. We do not commit to exploring or extensively testing console versions.
