# Goals

The goal of this guide is to provide a comprehensive and assertive resource for speedrunning the game "Blasphemous 2". This includes information on:

1. Every relevant technique, including but not retricted to possible skips and checks
2. Every scene in the game
3. Every boss fight, and an analysis of relevant enemies for specific set ups and skips
4. Every single weapon, from damage, combos, usability and relevant content
5. Chants as a whole, and in-depth for relevant Chants
6. Quick Verses as a whole, and in-depth for the two different categories of Verses

It will also include information about relevant assets, mods, spreadsheets, as well as links for downloadable content that can be used for speedruns regardless of categories and to create content about the game as a whole.

Although it may look like a Wiki and any person's contribution is encouraged, since one of the primary goals is to ensure that the project is assertive and reliable, all contributions will be subject to review by the project maintainers to verify their accuracy, which differs from the typical open editing approach of a wiki
