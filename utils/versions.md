# Versions

While the guide focuses on the Steam version of "Blasphemous 2," it is worth mentioning that the majority of the content and techniques apply equally to the GOG version of the game. Players on both platforms can benefit from the strategies and information provided here.

Please note that while many techniques may also work on console versions, the primary focus of this project is on the PC versions. We do not commit to exploring or extensively testing console versions. Users are encouraged to experiment and adapt the documented techniques to their respective platforms, but do so at their own discretion and risk.

Also, some techniques may behavior differently depends on fps (mainly 60/30 variations), and a few are only possible at 30 or less frames per second. When relevant it will be pointed out at the technique description. Notice 30fps only techniques can only be used at specific categories for speedrunning purposes.
