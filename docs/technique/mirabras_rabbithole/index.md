# Mirabras Rabbithole Techs

On the 1.0.5 version of the game, there are a quite a number of tricks and glitches made possible by the prayer Mirabrás of the Return to Port. This prayer when cast will bring up a menu at the end of a short animation with two options: "Return to the City" which will warp you from where you are to the Prie Dieu in the main room of City of the Blessed Name (z0501) and "Back" which will return you to normal gameplay without any fervour being spent. This prayer is highly prone to glitches because it has a number of unique properties.

1. The prayer opens up a menu in the middle of gameplay which freezes The Penitent One and all enemies until an option is selected
2. The prayer makes The Penitent One invulrabile for it's duration, even when the prayer itself has no response
3. The prayer allows you to warp to another map from almost any location in the game

Thanks to these properties and another glitch called Prayer Cancelling, there are a wide range of Mirabrás techniques. Almost all of these were patched out of version 1.0.5 and require at least two weapons or a quick verse in order to be performed:

- [Mirabras Cancelling](mirabras_cancel/)
  - [Time Stop](mirabras_cancel/time_stop)
