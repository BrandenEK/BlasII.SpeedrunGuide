## Description

Mirabras Cancelling is a variety of Prayer Cancelling that's performed while casting the prayer Mirabrás of the Return to Port. It allows you to regain control of The Penitent One while the prayer animation is playing. This trick allows a plethora of other glitches with various requirements (see [Mirabras Rabbithole](../)) There are three methods of performing this glitch:

- Menu Cancelling: a method with unique effects which is mainly used for [Time Stop](time_stop) and [Invulnerability](invulnerability)
- Weapon Swap Cancelling: the main method used for performing [Weight of Sin Techniques](../weight_of_sin/) and other glitches
- Verse Cancelling: an alternative to the weapon swap method with different requirements

When this glitch is activated with any method other than menu cancelling, the menu for returning to city or not will show up within about a second. During that time you may move around and do various actions with various different affects. During this window, your horizontal movement speed will be greatly reduced although dash and air dash speed will remain the same. When the menu comes up, TPO's current animation will become frozen until the menu is closed. Depending on the action, his current movement speed may be stored while the mirabras menu remains up. If "Back" is chosen, gameplay will return to normal. If "Return to the City" is chosen, TPO's movement will be fixed and TPO will be warped to the city as normal once the warping animation is complete. There are some scenarios where control can be maintained while the warping animation is playing, see [Wrong Warp](../travel_to_city/wrong_warp) for details.

## How to Perform

### Menu Cancel Method

**Requirements**: Mirabrás of the Return to Port

This method immediately cancels the rest of Mirabrás's activation and does not cause a menu to appear. It also skips the unfreezing of enemies and the reactivation of TPO's hitboxes.
Greater discussion of these effects can be found within [Time Stop](time_stop).

To perform this method, equip Mirabras and press down and B to cast the prayer. You must have enough fervour to cast the prayer. Anytime during the animation where TPO slams his weapon down, open your menu and go to the prayers menu. Here you need to change your equipped chant. This can be done by either equipping another chant over Mirabras, unequipping Mirabras, or unequipping then reequipping Mirabras or any other chant. Once you unpause the game the weapons slam cutscene will continue to play but you can move around and act freely. Most actions will interrupt the end of Mirabras's animation. This method was patched in version 1.1.0

### Weapon Swap Method

**Requirements**: Mirabrás of the Return to Port and at least two weapons unlocked

This method allows TPO to move around and perform actions before the Mirabras menu appears. To perform this method, equip Mirabras and press down and B to cast the prayer. You must have enough fervour to cast the prayer. Then press LB to swap your weapon anytime during the weapon slam animation and you will regain control of TPO until the Mirabras menu comes up. The earlier you weapon swap the longer you will have to control TPO before the menu appears. However, if you weapon swap as early as possible after casting Mirabras, the menu will not appear and only the animation for Mirabras will play. It's easy enough to tell when the weapon swap was too early because TPO's speed will not be slowed during the glitch.

### Verse Method

**Requirements**: Mirabrás of the Return to Port and at least one quick verse

This method behaves identically to the weapon swap method but provides a little less time to move after the cancel is performed. To perform this method, you must have at least enough fervour to cast your quick verse. Equip Mirabras then use down and B to cast Mirabras and pause your game as quickly as you can. Go to the prayers menu and change your equipped quick verse by either: unequiping and reequiping your current quick verse, equipping a different quick verse, or equipping a quick verse over an empty slot. Then unpause and perform a trick called Phantom Verse. To do this, as soon as you unpause press B and start as close to the same time as you can. TPO should begin the quick verse but no projectile should come out before the pause menu comes up. Then in the pause menu, change your quick verse equipment as before and unpause. TPO should perform a quick verse casting animation but no projectile should appear. You can cancel this strange animation at any time with any action. Now, you can move around freely and perform any action before the Mirabras menu comes up, just like with the other method.

You can perform this method without a Phantom Verse. After changing your equipped quick verse the first time, unpause and press B to cast your quick verse. Once the quick verse animation ends you can move around until the Mirabras menu appears. However, this method gives you much less time to perform actions before the menu comes up. Also, some actions will be changed in this state. For example, your jump will be cut much shorter and will barely get off the ground. This makes this version much less useful for performing many Mirabras tricks.

## List of Usages

The amount of different usages for this technique are numerous, mostly in the form of other techniques. See [Mirabras Rabbithole](../) for more details.
