## Description

Invulnerability is a glitch using the prayer Mirabrás of the Return to Port that allows you to ignore all enemy attacks and hurtboxes. Normally, the glitch is a side effect of [Menu Time Stop](time_stop), but under the right circumstances you can activate the glitch without stopping time. This trick was patched out in version 1.1.0

When Mirabras is cast, an ingame property called CanBeDamaged gets turned off. This prevents TPO from being hit by any attacks or enemy hitboxes while the prayer is cast. This property gets turned back on once an option is selected from Mirabras's menu. In rooms where Mirabras can't be cast, CanBeDamaged is turned off until the text "Your prayers had no response." leaves the screen. By using [Menu Mirabras Cancelling](index), The menu or textbox gets skipped entirely and CanBeDamaged never gets turned back on. The effect lasts until you save and reload, cast Mirabras again, fall into spikes or an endless pit, watch a cutscene, pick up an item, interact with a statue, or change your Armor. 

Armor is an invisible property that changes depending on what weapon is being held. When holding Ruego al Alba or Sarmiento & Centella, PTO's armor is "Armor 00 light". When holding Veredicto your armor becomes "Armor 00 heavy". Your armor does not affect your ingame defense or any other stat but changing armor does refresh certain properties including CanBeDamaged. This means that while Invulrability is active, switching onto or off of Veredicto will cancel the glitch.

For this reason, on the PC version it is often useful to use your keyboard to switch between weapons directly. For example, switching between S&C and Ruego to accomplish a Full WoS, then using your keyboard to switch back to S&C avoiding switching to Veredicto and breaking invulnerability. Weapon swap is typically bound to "1", "2", and "3" on the keyboard but are typically rebound for easy access. This can also be accomplished by changing the weapon order in the pause menu.

## Game Behavior

In any room where you can use Mirabras, activating Invulnerability will also activate [Time Stop](time_stop). Since time stop prevents progress in many places and is often hard to get rid off, it is usually best to get Invulnerability somewhere Mirabras has no response.

Mirabras has no response in East City ([Z0501](../../../scenes/z05/z0501)), boss rooms (both with or without the boss defeated), rooms that the Procession of Shadows can travel to (excluding their first location), and [Sueños de Incienso](../../../scenes/z05/index) rooms (such as the dream chapel, the Mistress of Mourning's arena, and the Tiento to your Thorned Hairs challenge).

## How to Perform

Invulnerability is activated simply by performing a Menu Mirabras Cancel. To do this, all that is required is that you cast Mirabrás of the Return to Port then open the menu and unequip or reequip the prayer. No other form of Mirabras Cancel or Time Stop will work since they will cause the Mirabras menu or textbox to appear.

Before performing this technique, make sure you have the right weapon equipped. Since swapping Veredicto will cancel the glitch, you want to carefully consider which weapon you will be most useful to you with the glitch active. If swapping weapons between Ruego and S&C, keep in mind your current weapon order.
